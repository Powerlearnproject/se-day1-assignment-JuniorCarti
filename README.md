Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

I.)  Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software Engineering is the art and science of designing, building and maintaining software solutions that solve real world problems. Its more than just writing code, its about creating reliable, efficient and scalable systems that empower people and industries in their daily lives.The main importance of Software Engineering in the technology industry include; 
1. Ability to handle large projects; Software Engineering uses techniques and procedures that reduce large chunks of the projects into manageable modules that can be worked on faster and achieve the desired software product.
2. Reduces complexity; Software Engineering techniques reduce large projects into manageable sub-modules that can be solved one at a time, an example is to use of agile methodology where every stage of development can be checked over and over, and software can be updated when new features and requirements come in.
3. Using software engineering saves time when using a software development technique.
4. Effective results from things created by that software product's set standards.
5. Reliability and needs of the user are achieved when using a software engineering technique.
6. Minimum cost, Software Engineers plan everything before the start of a software development to reduce cost on the things that wouldn't be needed.

II) Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
>Mastering Machine (1956-1957) - Hardware dependent high level languages
>Mastering Process(1968-1982) - Crisis Development Process
>Mastering Complexity(1983-1982) - 	Personal computer. Expanding data and functional convergence


III) List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1. Planning and Requirement Analysis; This is the most crucial phase of the SDLC, gather the requirements, define your project scope, set goals and objectives, and plan on the resources you'll use throughout the project.
2. Defining the requirements; when defining the requirements, you need to specify the functional and non-functional requirements, the technical requirements. These requirements need to be checked and read by stakeholders and, get approval from customers as well after which the requirements are approved.
3. Designing the architecture; A document known as Software Requirement Specification (SRS) is used to provide full requirements of the software that need to be fulfilled for the successful development of the software system.
4. Developing the product; After designing the whole system architecure you can now proceed to Developing the product , here you can chose the programming language you will use depending on the type of software you will develop for example , for cross platform applications you'd use dart, flutter and react native, for web applications you could use python.
5. Product Testing and Intergration; After product development, testing of the product is necessary before execution, e.g Firebase Test Lab provided by Google, here you must ensure all the bugs are tested , fixed and retested because you are now releasing your product to the market, you don't want any flaws.
6. Deployment and Maintenance of Products; After testing, the product is rolled out in phases before being fully deployed in a real working environment.

IV) Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
1. In terms of flexibility, waterfall methodology is highly inflexible once a phase is completed no additional features can be added, compared to Agile methodology which is highly flexible and changes can be made at every stage of the development cycle.
2. Waterfall uses an approach where each phase of the SDLC must be completed before moving on to the next phase, agile methodology is iterative and the product is delivered in small increments with continuos planning, testing and feedback;-continuos testing throughout the SDLC process
3. Limited user involvement throughout the waterfall SDLC until the testing phase compared to agile which allows continuos user involvement and feedback
4. Single Release at the end potentially longer time-to-market compared to agile which has gradual releases quicker time to market for incremental features.
5. In Waterfall model, less adaptable changes may be costly and time consuming compared to Agile which is highly adaptable to changing requirements.
6. Waterfall model is sequential and linear compared to agile which is cyclical and incremental.
   
V) Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
>Software developers create programs that help people to operate in day-to-day life.
Software developers write those lines of code using different programming languages to operate the software and command them what to do.
Their major role is to design and write code that is used to build everything from operating systems to apps to video games.
Software developers are involved in every phase of the software development process from determining user requirements and how they will use the software to releasing a ready app.
Software developers conduct testing and maintenance of the software, they ensure bugs are fixed to ensure smooth running of the software.
>Quality Assurance Engineer make sure that the softwares developed meet the standards of whatever they have been created to do. They test software to catch bugs, ensure all the features work properly and correctly and verify that everything meets the required standards
>Project Manager assigns and monitors duties of the whole software development cycle and ensures that project timelines are met and software product delivered on time, on budget and on schedule. 
>They take the overall responsibilities of the project, create a budget, assign roles, assign deadlines.

VI) Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
>Project Management IDEs make viewing the project directory structure much simpler which breaks down the tedious tasks of working with multiple files.
>Saving plenty of time and Effort IDEs often include a variety of tools that can not only assist you in organizing your code but also quickly highlight the error in your code. They also include a flexible combination of tools for compiling, building, testing, and deploying your code, through which you can automate these tasks eliminating the need to manually run each task.
>IDEs help you work faster by putting everything you need in one place writing code, fixing errors, and running your projects. While you can use a text editor and command-line tools, IDEs make things easier and more convenient.

VII) What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
> Changing requirements dealing with the changing requirements during the development process might be hard to adapt with. They Use flexible development methodologies such as Agile and Scrum to handle changing requirements effectively
>Collaboration: Collaborating with other team members, such as project managers, designers, and other developers, can be challenging as everyone have different working styles and goals. Hence Use collaboration tools such as communication platforms and version control systems to facilitate effective collaboration among team members
> Complexity ;Software systems have become increasingly complex, making it difficult for developers to understand and manage all the components of a system. They therefore Use design patterns and architecture principles to simplify the software systems and make it easy to understand and manage.
> Meeting Deadlines: Developers often work under tight deadlines, which can make it difficult to ensure the quality of the final product. They therefore Use project management techniques such as Agile development and Scrum to plan and manage work effectively.


VIII) Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
>Unit testing is a method of testing individual units of a software application for example testing the login page of an Android application, testing single units rather than the whole system, this method of testing allows you to identify and fix bugs earlier in the development process.
>Intergration testing is a method of testing how different units of a software application interact with each other, it is used to identify bugs that may arise when different units of a software application are combined, it helps to identify bugs that may arise when different units of a software application are combined together
>System Testing evaluates the overall functionality and performance of a complete and fully integrated software solution. It tests if the system meets the specified requirements and if it is suitable for delivery to the end-users. It checks the entire functionality of the system with different test scripts and also it covers the technical and business requirements of clients
>Acceptance Testing is a testing carried to find out whether the system meets the users requirements and demands or not. This testing helps the project team to know the further requirements from the users directly as it involves the users for testing



#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


IX) Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is crafting questions or statements to get the best possible responses from AI models, giving clear instructions to a very smart AI assistant e.g Chatgpt. By using prompt engineering, you can avoid vague answers by simply giving it clear instructions of simply what you want it to do.

X) Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
>An example is "Tell me about cats" the AI will definitely give a general answer, But if you ask that "Tell me about the history of domestic cats in China" you'll get a more focused and clear answer on the history of domestic cats not in the whole world but specifically in China.
